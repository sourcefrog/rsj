# Learning J

Start the interpreter with `cargo run`. 

J prompts for input with three spaces. Examples in these documents also show
your input indented by three spaces, and the computer's output flush left.

J reads an expression one line at a time, and then prints the value.

A very simple expression is simply a number:

```
   7
7
```
